    description %(
      This test suite evaluates the ability of a system to provide patient
      summary data expressed using HL7® FHIR® in accordance with the
      [International Patient Summary Implementation Guide (IPS
      IG) v1.1.0](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/STU1.1).

      Because IPS bundles can be generated and transmitted in many different
      ways beyond a traditional FHIR RESTful server, this test suite allows you
      to optionally evaluate a single bundle that is not being provided by a server in the
      'IPS Resource Validation Tests'.

      For systems that support a standard API for generating and communicating
      these bundles in accordance with the guidance provided in the IG, use the
      'IPS Operation Tests'.

      For systems that also provide a FHIR API access to the components resources
      of the IPS bundle, use the 'IPS Read Tests'.

      This suite provides two presets:
      * HL7.org IPS Server: Hosted reference IPS Server.  This is suitable for running
        the 'Operation' and 'Read' tests.  Resource IDs may not remain valid as this is an
        open server.
      * IPS Example Summary Bundle: Populates the 'IPS Resource Validation Test' with an
        example provided in the IG.
